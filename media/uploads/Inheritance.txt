1.whenever parameterized constructors get instansiated to a derived class, the base class parameters should be called by using the super method.

Example: super(int parameter1,String parameter2);


2.If the base class constructors without parameters is initialized manually, theres no problem .

3.If the base class constructors with parameters not initialized manually, there will be error displayed.

4.If the super constructor not called inside the derived class,By default the derived class constructor will call the super() method.
